<section id="About">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Jon Snow is the bastard son of Ned Stark who is warden of the north, one of the seven realms of westeros; a continent ruled by kings and queens all vying for the iron throne which controls the whole continent. He gets his name of Snow from being a child born with unmarried parents in the north of the continent, that's why he doesn't use the name Stark. (From Game Of Thrones)</p>

<section id="Skills">
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Jon is an incredibly skilled Swordfighter who isn't the best at plans in the show, and an intellectual genius who isn't that good with a sword in the books. Either way he goes against all odds with his own skills, without the support that his siblings would get since he is a bastard.</p>

<h2>Associates</h2>
<p>Jon is a brother of the Nights Watch, an ancient order of criminals or volunteers (like Jon) who take vows to fight at the top of the north in castles built on this giant wall made of ice, to defend the realms below from wildlings, who are people living beyond the wall, that Jon realises are just people and he does the noble thing and helps them. Or The Others, A group of White Walkers who are zombie-like creatures that aim to kill all of humanity. But most people south of the wall don't believe they exist</p>

        <li>"By the time the moon was full again, he would be back in Winterfell with his brothers.
            "Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King's Landing either. Even his own mother had not had a place for him. The thought of her made him sad. He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?</li>
